# tokio-cron-async

Simple CRON scheduler using Tokio for async jobs.

## Motivation

> Why?

I wanted something like [mvniekerk/tokio-cron-scheduler][1], but with async jobs.

> Why weren't this contributed to the mentioned repo?

Because I'm not confident in this implementation and the project I've built this for can tolerate potential risks.
It might be contributed there at later stages.

## Inspiration

- [mvniekerk/tokio-cron-scheduler][1]
